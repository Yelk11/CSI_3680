    "ingredients":[
       "1 cup gluten-free flour blend (such as Bob\u2019s Red Mill Gluten Free 1-to-1 Baking Flour)",
       "\u00be cup chickpea flour",
       "1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt",
       "3 large eggs",
       "2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil"
    ],
    "directions":[
       "Whisk together gluten-free flour blend, chickpea flour, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk eggs and oil in a small bowl to combine. 
       Add egg mixture to dry ingredients and stir with a fork to incorporate; mixture will be crumbly. Tip out onto a surface and knead until a smooth dough forms, about 3 minutes. Form dough into a ball and wrap tightly in plastic. Chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day to allow flour to hydrate (the longer you can let it rest, the better). 
       Roll out pasta according to pasta machine directions or roll out and cut by hand."
