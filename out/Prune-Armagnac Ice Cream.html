<h1>Prune-Armagnac Ice Cream</h1><p>2 cups roughly chopped pitted prunes</p><p>3 tablespoons Armagnac</p><p>4 cups milk</p><p>1 cup cream</p><p>1¼ cups sugar</p><p>12 large egg yolks</p><p>Pinch of salt</p><p>Place the prunes and enough water to cover in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat, then turn off the heat. Let the prunes cool in the liquid, then drain them well. Stir in the Armagnac, cover, and refrigerate overnight.In a large, heavy saucepan, bring the milk, cream, and 1 cup of the sugar to a simmer. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and the remaining ¼ cup of sugar. Remove the milk mixture from the heat and add a little to the egg yolk mixture to warm it, whisking constantly to keep the yolks from cooking. Pour the egg yolk mixture into the hot milk mixture, whisking the milk constantly as you pour.Return the custard to the stove and cook it over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until it thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon. Remove from the heat and strain it into a bowl. Stir in the salt and let cool completely.Chill the custard until it’s thoroughly cold, at least 4 hours. Freeze in an ice-cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fold the Armagnac-soaked prunes into the ice cream immediately after freezing while it’s still soft. Transfer to a container and place in the freezer until frozen solid, at least 2 hours.</p>
